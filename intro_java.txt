"Write-one,run where" principle by utilizing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
-Rather than forcing you to keep up with memory allocation (or 3rd party libraries) Java platform
provides memory management out of the box. Java application creates an object instance at runtime,
JVM automatically allocates memory space for that object from the HEAP (pool of memory set aide for the program to use)
Java garbage collector runs in the background, keeping track of which object the app is not using.
^^ This is implicit memory management since we don't ned to write any memory handling code.
Garbage collection is one of the essential features of Java platform performance.
